# Mianjee - Opensource property of Muunect

as of now this repo serves as a sandbox for the development of the Mianjee engine and its related tools.
main parts of the engine are located in src/engine/core

mianjee is used to make interactive videos and games in the browser.
the name mianjee comes from the persian word for mediator, and its a reference to the idea of a mediator between the user and the video/game.
our focus right now is mainly videos.
the intstructions for how the interactivity will be should be located in the src/engine/levels folder
in a level-\*.json file.

mianjee editor will be the second phase of the project
the editor will be the platform for users to create and edit their levels using a visual interface.
but for now we will have to write the levels by hand in a json format.
